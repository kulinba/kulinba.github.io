# Personal Portfolio

This repository holds a simple personal portfolio website. Open `index.html` in a browser to view.

How to customize:
- Replace `images/profile.jpg` with your photo.
- Update `index.html` text placeholders (name, about, project descriptions, contact email).
- Update project images in `images/` and links in the Projects section.

No build tools required — just a static site.
